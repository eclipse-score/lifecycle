    # When Sphinx runs inside a Bazel action (bazel build //:needs_json), the
    # CWD is the execroot / sandbox root and the JSON schema files are linked
    # there at their workspace-relative paths (src/...) because they are
    # declared as tools.  However, the Sphinx source tree lives under
    # bazel-out/…/_needs_json/_sources/, so literalinclude directives that
    # traverse four levels up from docs/module/…/user_guide/ land at
    # _sources/src/…, which Bazel does not populate automatically.  Copying
    # the files into the source tree directory makes literalinclude work
    # without touching the RST files or the external docs macro.
    #
    # For non-Bazel runs (bazel run //:docs, local sphinx-build) the source
    # JSON files already exist at srcdir.parent / "src" / …, so the guard
    # below is a no-op.
