    Objective: Verifies that a component with a NotExisting file_state ready
    condition only reaches its ready state once the configured file is gone.

    The initial run target contains a component that removes its ready
    condition file after a delay, and a second component depending on it.

    Expected Behaviour: The launch manager polls for the file and only starts
    the dependent component after the file has been removed.
