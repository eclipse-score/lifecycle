    Objective: Verifies that a component with a file_state ready condition only
    reaches its ready state once the configured file exists.

    The initial run target contains a component that touches its ready
    condition file after a delay.

    Expected Behaviour: The launch manager polls for the file and only starts
    the dependent component after the file has been created.
