    Objective: Verifies that recovery action is executed when the reporting of kRunning via LifecycleClient API (named "simple reporting" in the following) is not happening in time and vice versa.

    Case 1: Using simple reporting, the process does report kRunning in time (500ms below boundary)
    Expected Behaviour: Reporting kRunning is successful, recovery action is not executed.

    Case 2: Using simple reporting, the process does not report kRunning in time (500ms above boundary)
    Expected Behaviour: Reporting kRunning is not successful, recovery action is executed.
    The recovery action switches to the fallback run target, the activation of the fallback run target is verified in the test.
