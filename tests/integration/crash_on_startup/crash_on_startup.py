    Objective: Verifies that the launch manager correctly handles processes that crash before reporting kRunning.

    Case 1: Process crashes before Running state but eventually starts up successfully before the configured number of restart attempts is exceeded.
    Expected Behaviour: Process startup successful, RunTarget activation successful

    Case 2: Process keeps crashing, exceeding the number of restart attempts.
    Expected Behaviour: Process startup fails, LaunchManager executes recovery action.
