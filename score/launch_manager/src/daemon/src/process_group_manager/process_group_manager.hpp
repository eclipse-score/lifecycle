/// @brief ProcessGroupManager provides the core functionality of LCM.
/// Software that is deployed to the machine, should be managed through Process Groups.
/// A Process Group (PG) can be described as a set of applications, or executable files, that should be controlled in a
/// coherent way. Through a Process Group, Launch Manager will control the life cycle of Operating System (OS)
/// processes. They will be started and stopped when State Management (SM) request so and they will be started and
/// stopped in a way, that is described by integrator through configuration. When SM request PG change,
/// ProcessGroupManager will use ConfigurationManager to figure out what processes shall be started, or stopped, as well
/// as their startup configuration. Then ProcessGroupManager will use Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) to
/// start, or stop, processes as per configuration. Some of the responsibilities of ProcessGroupManager include:
///     Interaction with ConfigurationManager to ensure that, the list of processes that are running on Machine, is as
///     configured by integrator. Interaction with OSAL to start and stop processes. Interaction with OSAL to discover
///     when processes terminated in an unexpected way. Fulfilling PG State transitions requests from SM, as well as
///     informing SM about unexpected problems (for example process crashes).
