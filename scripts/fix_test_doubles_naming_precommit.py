"""Check that test doubles (mocks, stubs. etc.) follow our agreed naming convention.

This script searches for test doubles and optionally fixes any doubles with non-conforming filenames.
This is designed to be compatible with precommit hooks, where the files to check are passed as
parameters.

Usage:
    python3 ./fix_test_doubles_naming_precommit.py [-h] [--dry-run] [filenames ...]

Example:
    python3 ./fix_test_doubles_naming_precommit.py --dry-run component_mock.cpp
